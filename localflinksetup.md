# Prerequisite for Open Source Flink
For performinbg labs based on Open Source Apaceh Flink, we need a local Flink Cluster running:

- Docker
- Docker-compose

## Setup using Docker

- Make sure you have docker engine installed and docker-compse in your path.
- In  your terminal, Goto [docker-compose.yml](/flink/docker/docker-compose.yml) and type:
`docker-compose run sql-client`
- It will take some time and will get you started with sql-client, as we will be doing low-code sql examples here.
